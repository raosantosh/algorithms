/**
 * Created by s.rao on 3/28/18.
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

 Only one letter can be changed at a time.
 Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.
 For example,

 Given:
 beginWord = "hit"
 endWord = "cog"
 wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
 return its length 5.

  public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
    return -1;
  }

}
